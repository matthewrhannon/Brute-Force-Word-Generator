# Brute-Force-Word-Generator
Word Generator is able to create large listings of all possible combinatioms of normal or custom alphabet characters. Language is C++ and Win32.

# Summary
This is a small application whose sole purpose is to generate every possible combination of
alphanumeric characters or any character set that the user would like. For example this program could
be used to generate every four letter combination possible using only the letters found in ‘Matthew’.
This is the configuration I used to generate the file ‘Output.txt’ found in the binary directory. This
program seems to be unstable when producing large combinations of characters which could be
alleviated by using threads however this I have no intention to upgrade this application.
